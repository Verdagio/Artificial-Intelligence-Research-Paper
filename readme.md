# Artificial Intelligence & Consciousness

### Abstract

The following paper will delve into Artificial Intelligence
(AI) and its potential impact in the years to come, and
specific industries or topics. The first topic will review artificial
intelligence in video games, how it is currently implemented
across different genres of games, how it enriches or enhances
the overall experience of a title for the end user, and where it
could potentially go in the future if developers begin utilizing
technologies such as neural networks and machine learning.
The next topic will review artificial consciousness, how can
researchers test to see if a machine is self-aware or conscious
of its current situation. Could machines be considered living
entities in the future? Could our limitations, whether they are
related to knowledge, ethics, social, or political, be the reason
that artificial intelligence will struggle, or take longer than it
would naturally, to reach its true potential, with no restrictions
applied externally by us humans, or is it a technical restraint
such as hardware?
